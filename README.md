River Adventure
---------------------------------------------------
Project's name is River Adventure. The player is on a boat and moves toward one direction. Also the boat has three parallel paths to choose during the game. It has to change its path because on the paths, there will be obstacles and rewards. Obstacles are consist of rocks, garbages, cyclones and the rewards are consist of three types of fishes and seaweeds. Each type of fish has its own power efficiency and boat can move as long as its power point is more than zero. On the other hand, boat can collect fishes as long as it has seaweed because it is used as a net during the hunting. When the player is able to move without touching any obstacles or getting zero for power point, after some time the game gets faster as a next level. The aim of the player is to survive longer.

River Adventure
---------------------------------------------------
The game River Adventure is a first-person, desktop based game where the player tries to go down the river without crash into many obstacles. In the river, there are many type of obstacles as logs, stones, chemical hazards and nuclear bombs with unique damages along with many boosts that can either be unlocked and/or upgraded from the market or the ones that can only be found during the game that cannot be accessed through market. While swimming down the river, the player tries to collect as much coin as he/she can so that the player can unlock other characters or boost from the market or upgrade other previously bought boosts. After the player loses all of his/her health, the game finishes. After the game has finished, the score is calculated considering the time/distance the player travels and the amount of coin the player collects. The player can access his/her highest scores in the highscore table.
